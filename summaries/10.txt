400 Years of Beautiful, Historical, and Powerful Globes 

To look at an ancient globe is to look at the Earth as it was seen by the people of another time.
Contrary to the popular misconception that nobody knew the Earth was round before Columbus, the ancient Greeks described the making of globes (in verse, no less) in the third century B.C.
Even the typography and colors of a globe are indicative of the time and place of its origin, says Sylvia Sumira, a London-based conservator of ancient globes.
“If you go into a room and there’s a globe, your attention is immediately drawn to it,” Sumira said.
In the book, she writes that in the 17th century, globes were sold as “handsome objects of status and prestige to a comfortable merchant class.”
Not that ancient globes don’t convey some useful information.
