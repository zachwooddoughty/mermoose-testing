9 Nifty Kickstarter Designs That You Can Buy Right Now 



Since Kickstarter launched in 2009, more than 61,000 projects have been funded and brought to life.
Not all of them have been winners, but somewhere amongst the unfinished albums and misguided t-shirt ideas there are some real design gems.
These are the kinds of products that look so good and perform so well they rise above the crowdsourced masses. It’s the ultimate nod of approval: A crowdfunded design getting shelf time at a design institution.
“The filters we used in selecting the Kickstarter projects were the same we always use in seeking good design,” says Chay Costello, Assistant Director of Merchandising for MoMA .
To narrow the field, MoMA Store curators scoured Kickstarter for interesting projects.
