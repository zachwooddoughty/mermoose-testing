395-Horsepower VW Golf Is Pure, Wonderful Excess 



The Volkswagen GTi always has been a sensible, versatile hatchback with the soul of a sports car.
Like, for example, the Golf R 400 appearing at the Shanghai Auto Show.
The 400 refers to its claimed output, 400 pferdestärke, which translates to about 395 horsepower.
Put us down for one–if VW decides to actually build it.
It essentially created the “hot hatch” segment, and the GTi long has been an enthusiast’s car with occasional and delightful high-performance variations.
