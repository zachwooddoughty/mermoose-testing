10 Years Later, Final Fantasy Concerts Get a Much-Needed Reboot 


Music is more than symphony orchestras.
This has me excited about Final Fantasy concerts again.
Shouldn’t videogame music concerts be, as well?
I was there for the first ever live performance of music from the storied role-playing game series on North American soil in 2004, and watched as a sold-out crowd went totally bananas to hear their favorite music played live in the presence of composer Nobuo Uematsu.
Square Enix and producer Arnie Roth said this week that they will soon launch a new touring concert of music from the Final Fantasy games called “A New World: Intimate Music from Final Fantasy.” The concert promises “fresh arrangements of music… for a variety of chamber ensembles,” from string quartets to guitar solos.
